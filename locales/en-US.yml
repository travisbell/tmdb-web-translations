    explain: Currently, the only option we have to display a custom avatar is by using a service called <a href="https://www.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>. If you would like to display a custom avatar on TMDb, you will have to sign up for an account on Gravatar and make sure to add the same email address you used here (that's how we can link your account). Once this has been done, click the update button below and we'll grab your new image.
    explain_gravatar: If you would like to use <a href="https://www.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> as the provider of your avatar, make sure you have the same email address you use here added on Gravatar. Once that is done (and you have uploaded an image of course), click the update button below and we'll try to grab your new image.
