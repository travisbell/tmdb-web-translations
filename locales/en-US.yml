        Hi there, thanks for using TMDB. I noticed you're browsing TMDB in a language that isn't finished being translated. If you have any interest in helping us get this data completed, you can do so by visiting our [Locale project](https://www.localeapp.com/projects/8267). [Signing up](https://www.localeapp.com/users/sign_up) for Locale is free and you can add as many new translations as you have time for. Every edit helps.

        If you don't have any interest in this, don't sweat it. I just thought I'd ask.

        Thanks and take care!
